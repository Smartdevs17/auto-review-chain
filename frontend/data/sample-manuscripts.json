      "abstract": "This paper presents novel machine learning approaches for improving climate prediction models. We introduce a hybrid neural network architecture that combines convolutional and recurrent layers to capture both spatial and temporal patterns in climate data. Our experiments on 20 years of historical data show a 15% improvement in prediction accuracy compared to traditional methods.",
